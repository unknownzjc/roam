## Highlights
- People think a revolution needs to involve loud provocations, fists in the air, and bloodshed. But if you think true love looks like Romeo and Juliet, you’ll overlook a great relationship that grows slowly. If you think your life’s purpose needs to hit you like a lightning bolt, you’ll overlook the little day-to-day things that fascinate you. If you think revolution needs to feel like war, you’ll overlook the importance of simply serving people better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtny90a1w5rsv95jfd0fy13b))
    - Note: 大的改变并不需要以一个非常宏大的行动来开始。多着眼于细节处，从细节去发现美好。

    - Note: 学会说不，遵从内心的想法💡，如果不是非常狂人的想做，那就拒绝，把时间花在你渴望的事情上
- Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers. Make every decision—even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone—according to what’s best for your customers. If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.

    - Note: 想起了阿服的客户导向
- None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding. They want you to keep your attention focused on them. It’s counterintuitive, but the way to grow your business is to focus entirely on your existing customers. Just thrill them, and they’ll tell everyone.
