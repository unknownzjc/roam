## Highlights
- It’s time to elevate the status of notes from test prep and humble scribblings into something far more interesting and dynamic. For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

    - Note: 是时候将笔记的状态从考试准备和简陋的涂鸦提升到更有趣和更有活力的东西了。对于现代的专业笔记，笔记是一个“知识积木”——一个离散的信息单元，通过你独特的视角解释并存储在你的头脑之外。
- a note could include a passage from a book or article that you were inspired by; a photo or image from the web with your annotations; or a bullet-point list of your meandering thoughts on a topic, among many other examples. A note could include a single quote from a film that really struck you, all the way to thousands of words you saved from an in-depth book. The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.

    - Note: 笔记可以包含您受到启发的书籍或文章中的一段话；来自网络的带有您的注释的照片或图像；或您对某个主题的曲折想法的要点列表，以及许多其他示例。笔记可以包括真正打动您的电影中的一句话，一直到您从一本有深度的书中保存的数千个单词。长度和格式无关紧要——如果一段内容已经通过你的镜头进行了解读，根据你的品味进行了整理，翻译成你自己的文字，或者从你的生活经历中汲取灵感，并存储在一个安全的地方，那么它就是合格的作为注释。
- In our Second Brain we can do the same: mix up the order of our ideas until something unexpected emerges. The more diverse and unusual the material you put into it in the first place, the more original the connections that will emerge.

    - Note: 在我们的第二大脑中，我们可以做同样的事情：混合我们想法的顺序，直到出现意想不到的事情。您首先放入其中的材料越多样化和不寻常，就会出现越原始的联系。
- To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I’ve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmtdmarfp5r0ss6b2n7twqb))
    - Note: 为了指导您创建自己的第二大脑，我开发了一种简单、直观的四部分方法，称为“CODE”——捕获；组织;蒸馏;表达。
- The solution is to *keep only what resonates* in a trusted place that you control, and to leave the rest aside. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmtf9q4c397wb3mvyryqktm))
    - Note: 只保留让你共鸣的内容，认知觉醒那本书也是如此说明，不知道是不是参考这里的。
- It is tempting to try to create a perfect hierarchy of folders up front to contain every possible note you might ever want to capture. Even if it was possible, that approach would be incredibly time-consuming and require way too much effort, pulling you away from what interests you today.

    - Note: 这个跟 Roam Research 的理念有点类似， RR 强调的是毫无压力的记录自己的想法，所以搞了个 dailyNote 出来。
- The best way to organize your notes is to *organize for action* , according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its *utility* , asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmtqz1tm4x3afsvdgpbf0rd))
    - Note: 根据自己当前进行的活动项目来组织行动？啥意思
