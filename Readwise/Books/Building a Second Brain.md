## Highlights
- It’s time to elevate the status of notes from test prep and humble scribblings into something far more interesting and dynamic. For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

    - Note: 是时候将笔记的状态从考试准备和简陋的涂鸦提升到更有趣和更有活力的东西了。对于现代的专业笔记，笔记是一个“知识积木”——一个离散的信息单元，通过你独特的视角解释并存储在你的头脑之外。
- a note could include a passage from a book or article that you were inspired by; a photo or image from the web with your annotations; or a bullet-point list of your meandering thoughts on a topic, among many other examples. A note could include a single quote from a film that really struck you, all the way to thousands of words you saved from an in-depth book. The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.

    - Note: 笔记可以包含您受到启发的书籍或文章中的一段话；来自网络的带有您的注释的照片或图像；或您对某个主题的曲折想法的要点列表，以及许多其他示例。笔记可以包括真正打动您的电影中的一句话，一直到您从一本有深度的书中保存的数千个单词。长度和格式无关紧要——如果一段内容已经通过你的镜头进行了解读，根据你的品味进行了整理，翻译成你自己的文字，或者从你的生活经历中汲取灵感，并存储在一个安全的地方，那么它就是合格的作为注释。
- In our Second Brain we can do the same: mix up the order of our ideas until something unexpected emerges. The more diverse and unusual the material you put into it in the first place, the more original the connections that will emerge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmt6rqha6t0w1a7e162r2y9))
    - Note: 在我们的第二大脑中，我们可以做同样的事情：混合我们想法的顺序，直到出现意想不到的事情。您首先放入其中的材料越多样化和不寻常，就会出现越原始的联系。
- To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I’ve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmtdmarfp5r0ss6b2n7twqb))
    - Note: 为了指导您创建自己的第二大脑，我开发了一种简单、直观的四部分方法，称为“CODE”——捕获；组织;蒸馏;表达。
- The solution is to *keep only what resonates* in a trusted place that you control, and to leave the rest aside. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmtf9q4c397wb3mvyryqktm))
    - Note: 只保留让你共鸣的内容，认知觉醒那本书也是如此说明，不知道是不是参考这里的。
- It is tempting to try to create a perfect hierarchy of folders up front to contain every possible note you might ever want to capture. Even if it was possible, that approach would be incredibly time-consuming and require way too much effort, pulling you away from what interests you today. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmtkt6smqvq1vpahpegjtcc))
    - Note: 这个跟 Roam Research 的理念有点类似， RR 强调的是毫无压力的记录自己的想法，所以搞了个 dailyNote 出来。
- The best way to organize your notes is to *organize for action* , according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its *utility* , asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxmtqz1tm4x3afsvdgpbf0rd))
    - Note: 根据自己当前进行的活动项目来组织行动？啥意思

- Ask yourself, “What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?” This could include grand, sweeping questions like “How can we make society fairer and more equitable?” as well as practical ones like “How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?” It might include questions about relationships, such as “How can I have closer relationships with the people I love?” or productivity, like “How can I spend more of my time doing high-value work?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnetpp38qvb2qjbwfxq65ga))
    - Note: 这里提供了一个更好的视角去认识读书这件事，要从自己感兴趣的话题入手，这样会更少的被功利性的东西影响。通过功利性的东西驱动的往往不长久，而通过兴趣驱动的会更加的持续。从自己的问题入手，通过问题去寻找答案，然后分享。
- For example, I keep a folder full of customer testimonials I’ve received over the years. Any time I think what I’m doing doesn’t matter or isn’t good enough, all I have to do is open up that folder and my perspective is completely shifted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnh1cmfpktttn9cvrn475y7))
    - Note: 建立一个文件夹，收集激励你的东西，名言，照片，故事。这些东西可以激发你的想象力。
- Sometimes you come across an idea that is neither inspiring, personal, nor obviously useful, but there is something surprising about it. You may not be able to put your finger on why, but it conflicts with your existing point of view in a way that makes your brain perk up and pay attention. Those are the ideas you should capture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnh5gvfwfamys76mdm4yr0w))
    - Note: 记录反直觉的东西。
- The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnh84czvtfemws3jzbfxj1g))
- You can intentionally train yourself to hear that voice of intuition every day by taking note of what it tells you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnhb1sg303f8szn3ex5qc47))
    - Note: follow your heart
- Each word you write triggers mental cascades and internal associations, leading to further ideas, all of which can come tumbling out onto the page or screen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnhnhgm2g6k76gjcqgfkxts))
    - Note: 想法会自己涌现，首先你要先写出来。
- The moment you first encounter an idea is the worst time to decide what it means. You need to set it aside and gain some objectivity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnhrqtxns5140kk74ka51h2))
    - Note: 让子弹再飞一会儿。
- On average I capture just two notes per day—what are two ideas, insights, observations, perspectives, or lessons you’ve encountered today that you could write down right now? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnhyxj9b5rqqnpeak7k91s9))
    - Note: 先从少量的记录做起，培养习惯。

- Distillation is at the very heart of all effective communication. The more important it is that your audience hear and take action on your message, the more distilled that message needs to be. The details and subtleties can come later once you have your audience’s attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxr3kwxqj1x2t62c5j1pt1ss))
- you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of *those* highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxr3p119a9a43d2p64wz1y6f))
- I came across the link when it was shared on social media and saved it with two clicks to my read later app, where I collect bookmarks of everything I want to read, watch, or listen to. A few evenings later, when I wanted to do some casual reading to wind down for the day, I read the article and highlighted the passages I found most interesting. I have my read later app synced to my digital notes app, so any passage I highlight there automatically gets saved in my notes, including a link to the source. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxr3tqjq9m3zv5vggm3r95sd))
- I usually do this when I have free time during breaks or on evenings or weekends, when I come across the note while working on other projects, or when I don’t have the energy for more focused work. All I have to do is bold the main points within the note. This could include keywords that provide hints of what this text is about, phrases that capture what the original author was trying to say, or sentences that especially resonated with me even if I can’t explain why. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxr3xnfd8d2w76rv6ard43qy))
- I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words. The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself visiting a note again and again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxr45858ym89wwx6p02gvt4m))
